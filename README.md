# CSCI-5408-Project

The main purpose of this project is to use MNIST database of hand written digits to train an image recognition system that can correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 

The MNIST database is available at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The MNIST database is a dataset of handwritten digits. It has 60,000 training samples, and 10,000 test samples. Each image is represented by 28x28 pixels, each containing a value 0 - 255 with its grayscale value.

Here Traditional_methods.ipynb is the file in which I have applied Logistic regression, random forest,etc classifiers to the MNIST dataset.
MNIST.ipynb is the file in thich I have applied Convolutional Neural Network on MNIST dataset
